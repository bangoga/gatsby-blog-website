// <br></br>Cannibal Holocaust is a 1980 Italian cannibal horror film directed by Ruggero Deodato and written by Gianfranco Clerici. 
//             It stars Robert Kerman as Harold Monroe, an anthropologist from New York University who leads a rescue team into the Amazon rainforest to locate a 
//             crew of filmmakers. Played by Carl Gabriel Yorke, Francesca Ciardi, Perry Pirkanen, and Luca Barbareschi, the crew had gone missing while filming a 
//             documentary on local cannibal tribes. When the rescue team is only able to recover the crew's lost cans of film, an American television station wishes to 
//             broadcast the footage as a sensationalized television special. Upon viewing the reels, Monroe is appalled by the team's actions and objects to the station's 
//             intent to air the documentary.<br></br><br></br>

//             Influenced by the documentaries of Mondo director Gualtiero Jacopetti,[1][3] Cannibal Holocaust was inspired by Italian media coverage of Red Brigade terrorism. 
//             The coverage included news reports that Deodato believed to be staged, an idea which became an integral aspect of the film's story.[4] Approximately half of the 
//             film consists of the documentary crew's lost footage, the presentation of which innovated the found footage genre that was later popularized in American cinema by 
//             The Blair Witch Project. Noted for its realism, Cannibal Holocaust was filmed primarily on location in the Amazon rainforest of Colombia with indigenous tribes 
//             interacting with American and Italian actors.[5]<br></br><br></br>

//             Cannibal Holocaust achieved notoriety as its graphic violence aroused a great deal of controversy. After its premiere in Italy, it was ordered to be seized by a 
//             local magistrate, and Deodato was arrested on obscenity charges. He was later charged with multiple counts of murder due to rumors that claimed several actors were 
//             killed on camera. Although Deodato was cleared of these charges, the film was banned in Italy, Australia, and several other countries due to its graphic content, 
//             including sexual assault and genuine violence toward animals. Although some nations have since revoked the ban, it is still upheld in several countries. 
//             In retrospective analyses, the film's violence has been noted as commentary on ethics in journalism, exploitation of developing countries, and the nature of modern 
//             society versus uncivilized society, although these interpretations have also been met with criticism</p>
