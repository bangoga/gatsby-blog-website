This is going to be a long one, and maybe not even appreciated by a lot of people but here it goes.
<br></br>
I’ve had quite some time to think about this topic. The idea of getting mental health help is being promoted crazy recently. 
With most university pushing the envelope trying to get students to normalize getting mental health services to celebrities and 
youtube sensations advocating for getting help over apps like BetterHelp. Now before i go on saying anything more, 
i’d like to point out that I’m not against getting help, my concerns are not over the idea of mental health services but 
the state of mental health services themselves.

For anyone who’s been through the system of getting counseling or care, 
the imagery of sitting in front of another human being and being expected to spill out the narrative that has defined you is pretty vivid. 
It's a daunting task to expose yourself and be so vulnerable in front of a complete stranger and the fact that they don’t exactly reciprocate that vulnerability 
doesn’t make it any better. But hey we are encouraged to pay that 150$ per session in return of the hope that maybe just talking about what is bothering us will also 
‘fix’ us, but that's not the case. Many a times these counseling sessions will fall short of what we’d expect which pretty much boils down to the way counsellors are trained. 
Depersonalized, that's the keyword for most therapist, keep the sessions depersonalized, and guide them through objective reasoning. The idea of making sure that clients don’t 
see you as a friend is very important but at the same time that kind of makes all this a balancing beam where you have to be empathic but also subjective? Personally I believe 
in the process of being subjective, you can lose a bit of your humanity. We are all human, sensitive to the both micro and macro expressions of individuals, which in turn keeps 
us connected to others and sane, but being too subjective, could lead to be seen as objects of study and as a result just doesn’t build that connection; this gets even worse 
when apps like betterhelp builds a layer of abstraction between the individuals. What happens then? Well you spend that 150$ to bounce between one therapist to another till you 
find one you can connect with? I just find that insane, especially considering a lot of the clients they’d have just need someone to talk to and feel human with, but instead 
end up getting the complete opposite.

Another issue I have is with the insane amount of labelling that just goes around with mental health services. 
Every other kid is labelled as ADHD, every other person is labelled as anxious, and sometimes mislabelled as depressive as well. 
Note, I’m not saying there aren’t people who are what they have been labelled as, i’m saying that it's easy to just label a person as one marker in the list of 
mental disorder and tell them hey look there are others like you too. What sometimes isn’t discussed is that everyone feels depressed at some points in their life and 
everyone is anxious about something. Its called being human, and that's the only label that's needed, and the only thing needed from therapist is understanding the underlying 
reasons for their unresolved feelings. As unpopular of an opinion as it might be, I’m against labelling kids, they need to be supported and helped first; with labels comes to 
obsession of pushing for taking pills or the scare of the label becoming part of one's identity. We are more that the wounds of our past and the weaknesses shown in crisis.

So what am i even trying to say then? That mental health care is bad? No. Mental health care should always be sought when needed but alot of our problems stem from the lack of 
humanity we tend to show each other in our daily lives. We are all human, going through our own stories with our struggles. Take time to know these stories, take time to show 
compassion, take time to be human. Reach for your friendships and relationships with a sense of curiosity but also humanity. Sometimes a mutual vulnerability proves to be more 
therapy than 150$ session once every two weeks.

TL;DR : Read the last paragraph. 
Here is a link that kinda inspired me to think about this, don't agree with everything he says but gives some valuable insight how therapy can sometimes be 
treated as any other medical care system<br></br></p>"
